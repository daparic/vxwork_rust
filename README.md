This is some task and bindings to the vxworks 7 sdk.

To run this, you would need the sdk, you can find it [here](https://forums.windriver.com/t/vxworks-software-development-kit-sdk/).

Unzip the sdk, and you can clone this repo in the sdk, or change the path to sdk in the Makefile.

Afther this you can just run `make`, and you will get some executable in `target/x86_64-wrs-vxworks/release`.

You can learn how to run them [here](https://labs.windriver.com/downloads/wrsdk-vxworks7-docs/2309/README_qemu.html).
